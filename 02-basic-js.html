         1. Write code that switches the values of variables a and b, but this time put it inside a function
         (the function `switchValuesOfAAndB` is already provided to you, you just need to write the code inside it).
         2. Write an event listener for the "Log results in the console" button that calls the function `logValuesOfAAndB`
         (line 54).

         The other event listeners (the one in line 49 and the one you'll need to add) are added inside of it
         because the buttons with id="switch" and id="results" are not yet available when the script is executed,
         so we need to wait for the HTML to be loaded and parsed before we can add the event listener.

         (open the console to see the error).

  <body>
    1. Write the code to switch the values of a and b inside the body of the function `switchValuesOfAAndB` (line 22).
    <br>
    2. Write an event listener for the "Log results in the console" button that calls the function `logValuesOfAAndB` (line 54).
    <br>
    <br>
    When you're done, open the file in any browser (or refresh the page if it's already open),
    <br>
    then open the console, click on "Switch" below to switch the values of a and b,
    <br>
    and then click on "Log results in the console" to see if you were successful :)
    <br>
    If you don't see the "Switched successful" message in the console, it means that either (1) or (2) is not working
    <br>
    (or both of them).
    <br>
    <br>
    <button id="switch">Switch!</button>
    <button id="results">Log results in the console</button>
