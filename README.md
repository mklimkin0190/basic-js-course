# Basic JS for beginner frontenders

Exercises on the fundamentals of JS for frontend people with no programming background.

## How to use

You will need a text editor and a browser with a developer console, and that's it!

Each exercise is an html file. The tasks are found in the comments inside the `<script>` tag, together with some code to start with.

1. Open the html file in text editor of choice.
2. Find the task and the links to relevant documentation.
3. Write the missing code.
4. Open the html file in the browser and open the browser dev console (i.e. [how to open Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/)).
